WebPage implementing the RestCountries.eu API.

As this is a SPA, the ony thing needed to run is to download the files (index and src folder) and open the index.
There, type the country to search for and click the "Search" button. The search command uses the "Full name" of the country. 

Note: There are some tweaks and improvements that can be done but this is the delivery for the time being.
