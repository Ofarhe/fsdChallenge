# fsdChallenge
WebPage implementing the RestCountries.eu API.
As this is a SPI, the ony thing needed to run is to download the index and src folder on the same file location and open the index.
There, add the country to search for.

Note: There are some parts still being implemented but the main functionality is already up :D

Thanks!
