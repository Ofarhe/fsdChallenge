# fsdChallenge
WebPage implementing the RestCountries.eu API.
As this is a SPI, the ony thing needed to run is to download the index and src folder on the same file location and open the index.
There, add the counrty to search for.

Note: There are some parts I couldn't implement, like showing all the results on the cards.
The query and the results are stored in the corresponding variables but didn't implemented it.
Given a litle more of work, Iit can be implemented :D

Thanks!
